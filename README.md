## Description

Campfire is a communication app for Coding Bootcamp attendees.

Campfire was created to serve as the go to social media of a Coding Bootcamp student. In this application, old and new students will have the opportunity to bond and network with one another in a more direct way than they do during classes or through Slack. When joining the application, students will find others who are going through similar experiences and obstacles. Hence, users are guaranteed to make significant connections with one another. 

Since users will have the ability post about new technologies that they have tried or want to learn about, and also check what other users have been posting lately, this app will serve users as a source of knowledge about revolutionary technologies, as well as a source of help with technologies that are new to the students.
